Implementation of the [HNPWA](https://hnpwa.com/) benchmark in Blazor.

**Showcases:**
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and minification build pipeline, since it is my favorite way to write CSS.
- Code-behind components
- Server-side prerendering
- Progressive web application (PWA) capabilities
- Optional: virtualization (if it improves performance)
