Implementation of the (HNPWA)[https://hnpwa.com/] benchmark in Blazor.

**Showcases:**
- (Fluxor)[https://github.com/mrpmorris/Fluxor] for the general architecture of the app. It's overkill for an app this size, but a good demo.
- (Tailwind CSS)[https://tailwindcss.com/] build pipeline for Blazor, since it is my favorite way to write CSS.
- Server-side prerendering
- Progressive web application (PWA) capabilities
- Optional: virtualization (if it improves performance)
